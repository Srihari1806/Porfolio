# Srihari Beesetti — Creative Writer & Story Architect

**Tagline:** Telugu-native storyteller blending cinematic instincts, lyric craft, and sharp comedy timing.

## About
I write across formats: Telugu lyrics, short-form scripts, pitch-ready loglines, scene fragments, and content for social platforms. My strengths are cinematic structure, emotive lyrical voice, native Telugu rhythm and idiomatic punch, and comedy timing that brings characters to life.

## What I do
- **Lyric writing:** Songs rooted in Telugu sensibility — nostalgia, longing, romance, and situational humor.
- **Screenwriting:** Short scenes, dialogues, and web-series concepts with clear emotional beats and production-ready notes.
- **Content & SEO-friendly writing:** Blog-style analyses, film breakdowns, and platform copy optimized for discoverability.
- **Comedy & Dialogue:** Punchline-first dialogue and timing for reels, sketches, and character-driven comedy.
